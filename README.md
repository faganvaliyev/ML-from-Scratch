Overview

This repository aims to implement and demonstrate the core concepts of machine learning algorithms from scratch. By implementing algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and more, the goal is to help users understand the inner workings of these models and how they can be built step-by-step.
Algorithms Implemented
Linear Regression

An implementation of the simple and multiple linear regression models, which predict a continuous value based on linear relationships between features.
Logistic Regression

An implementation of the decision tree algorithm that splits the dataset based on feature values to create a tree-like structure for classification or regression.
Support Vector Machines

A machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. It tries to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in the dataset.
K-Nearest Neighbors

A simple, non-parametric classification algorithm that assigns a class based on the majority class of its K nearest neighbors.
Naive Bayes

A probabilistic classification algorithm based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
K-Means Clustering

A popular clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into K clusters by iteratively minimizing the distance between points and their corresponding cluster centroids.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the dataset into a new coordinate system to reduce its size while preserving as much variance as possible.
